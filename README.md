# User-Analysis

### Project Description
In this dashboard I analyzed steps taken by users from registration to first payment.

I started with calulating Three Key Metrics:
+ Number of registered users
+ Number of users who started a trial
+ Number of users who made a payment

Next, I created a chart of monthly registrations and trial conversions. It displays the number of registrations and conversions to trial for each registration month.

Another chart presents average number of days between registration and payment by registration month.

Finally, I created a funnel chart. It visualizes how users move through each step, including both absolute numbers (users at each step) and relative conversion rates.
